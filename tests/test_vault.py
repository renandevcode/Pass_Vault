test_vault.py

Tests for the vault module — file format, persistence, entry CRUD

These tests DO touch the filesystem (via pytest's `tmp_path` fixture)
because the vault's whole job is reading and writing files. Every
fixture cleans up after itself when the test ends, so the suite
leaves no debris behind

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
What is being verified, organized by section
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Vault creation — `UnlockedVault.create()` writes a file at the
   given path with the right format, the right permissions, and
   refuses to clobber an existing vault

2. Round-trip — save a vault, reopen it, get back exactly what was
   stored. Verify wrong-password, missing-file, malformed-file,
   and out-of-range KDF parameters all raise the right exceptions

3. Entry dataclass — Entry is frozen (cannot be mutated after
   construction); from_dict refuses corrupted input loudly instead
   of silently filling in defaults for required fields

4. Entry operations — add / get / delete / names. Duplicate
   detection, the `force` overwrite flag, sort order, entry-name
   validation that rejects leading/trailing whitespace

5. Master password rotation — change_master_password rotates BOTH
   the salt AND the key. After rotation the old password no longer
   works; the new password unlocks; all entries survive

6. Lifecycle — close() and the context-manager `with` block both
   drop the key + entries from memory when done

7. Persistence — every save produces a fresh nonce, never leaves a
   stale .tmp file, and uses the secure 0600 file mode from the
   very first syscall

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A short pytest primer for this file
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
`tmp_path` (built-in fixture)
    Pytest creates a fresh empty temporary directory for each test
    and passes its Path here. Auto-cleaned at test end

`monkeypatch` (built-in fixture)
    Lets you temporarily replace attributes on objects (functions,
    modules, classes) for the duration of one test. We use it to
    spy on `os.open` and to simulate `os.replace` failing. After
    the test ends, the original attributes are restored

`@pytest.mark.parametrize("name", [v1, v2, v3])`
    Runs the same test function once per value. So a single
    `test_x(name)` becomes 3 separate tests, each with a different
    name. Cleaner than writing 3 near-identical test functions

`fresh_vault` and `master_password` (from conftest.py)
    Fixtures we defined ourselves. Pytest sees them in the test
    function's parameters and wires them in automatically

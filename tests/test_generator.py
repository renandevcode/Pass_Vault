Tests for the password generator — what it produces and what it refuses

Every test below is one Python function whose name starts with `test_`.
pytest discovers them automatically when you run `just test`, and runs
each one in isolation so a failure in one cannot poison another

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
What the generator must guarantee
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. The result is exactly the requested length
2. Every character class the user enabled appears at least once.
   This is what makes the generated password pass "must contain a
   digit / symbol / uppercase" rules on websites
3. Short or impossible requests are rejected loudly, never silently
   "fixed" to something else

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A short pytest primer for this file
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
`assert <expr>`
    pytest fails the test if <expr> is falsy

`pytest.raises(SomeError)`
    A context manager that wraps a code block. The block MUST raise
    SomeError or the test fails. This is how we verify "refuses bad
    input" without having to predict the exact wording of the error

`any(c in pool for c in password)`
    Returns True if AT LEAST one character of password is in pool

`all(c in pool for c in password)`
    Returns True only if EVERY character of password is in pool

`set(...)`
    Builds a Python set, which silently discards duplicates.
    `len({generate_password(16) for _ in range(100)}) == 100` is a
    clean way to assert "100 generated passwords were all unique"

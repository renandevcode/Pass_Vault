The vault — how we store entries on disk safely

This file is the bridge between two worlds. On one side is the
user's data: a dictionary of entries like {"github": <username,
password, url, ...>}. On the other side is a single file on disk
that needs to be encrypted, tamper-evident, and survive crashes
without corruption

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The on-disk format
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
We store the vault as a JSON file. Plain JSON is human-inspectable
and trivially portable. Inside, the structure looks like this

  {
    "version": 1,
    "kdf": {
      "name": "argon2id",
      "salt": "<base64 random bytes>",
      "time_cost": 3,
      "memory_cost": 65536,
      "parallelism": 4
    },
    "cipher": {
      "name": "aes-256-gcm",
      "nonce": "<base64 random bytes>",
      "ciphertext": "<base64 encrypted blob>"
    }
  }

The cleartext (un-encrypted) plaintext that gets fed to AES looks
like another JSON document — a dictionary of entries

  {
    "github": {
      "username": "alice",
      "password": "...",
      "url": "https://github.com",
      "notes": "",
      "created_at": "2026-05-10T12:34:56",
      "updated_at": "2026-05-10T12:34:56"
    },
    "...": {...}
  }

So the file is "JSON envelope wrapping encrypted JSON." Nice and
boring. Boring is good in security — fewer custom things to
get wrong

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Atomic + durable writes — never corrupt or lose a vault on a crash
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
If we wrote directly to vault.json and the process died halfway
through, the file would be half-old, half-new — corrupt. We use the
"write to temp file, fsync, then rename" pattern

  1. open vault.json.tmp with mode 0600 (never world-readable)
  2. write the encrypted bytes
  3. fsync the file's bytes to disk (otherwise they live only in the
     kernel page cache, which a power loss erases)
  4. os.replace vault.json.tmp onto vault.json (atomic rename)
  5. fsync the parent directory (otherwise the rename itself can
     evaporate on power loss, leaving us with stale content)

At any instant after step 4, readers see either the OLD complete
file or the NEW complete file — never half of either

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
File locking — never let two `pv` processes overwrite each other
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Two `pv add` invocations against the same vault could otherwise
race: each unlocks, each adds a different entry, each saves. Whoever
saves second wipes the first one's entry. We hold an advisory
fcntl lock on a sidecar `.lock` file during the encrypt-and-write
window, so the second process blocks until the first finishes

On Windows fcntl is unavailable; we skip the lock there. NTFS still
gives us atomic os.replace, we just lose cross-process serialization

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
What this file exposes
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Entry              — one credential row (username, password, etc.)
  UnlockedVault      — an opened, in-memory vault (holds the key)
  VaultError + subclasses — errors callers can catch by type

UnlockedVault is a context manager: use `with vault.unlock(...) as v:`
so the AES key and plaintext entries are dropped at block exit

Connects to
  crypto.py — calls derive_key, encrypt, decrypt
  constants.py — file format keys, default paths, file mode
  main.py — the CLI uses UnlockedVault.create / .unlock / .save

             on disk is either the OLD complete file or the NEW
             complete file. Never half of either
          2. Durable — we fsync the data before the rename and
             fsync the parent directory after, so a power loss cannot
             leave us with a 0-byte file or a stale-content-with-new-mtime
             outcome. Without these fsyncs, "atomic" is a story the
             page cache tells us, not a guarantee on disk
          3. Concurrent-safe — we hold an advisory file lock on a
             sidecar .lock file for the whole encrypt-and-write
             window, so two `pv add` processes cannot race and have
             one's save silently overwrite the other's
          4. Secure-by-creation — we open the tmp file with mode 0600
             from the very first syscall, so it is never briefly
             visible to other users with broader permissions

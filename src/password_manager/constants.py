constants.py

Every "magic number" and fixed string the project uses, in one place

A "constant" is a value that never changes while the program runs
Beginners often hard-code numbers like `length = 16` directly into
the code that uses them — and then six months later, nobody remembers
why 16. By collecting every constant up here with a name and a
comment explaining its meaning, the rest of the codebase becomes
self-documenting

Three big buckets live here

1. Crypto parameters — sizes and tuning knobs for Argon2id (the key
   derivation function) and AES-256-GCM (the encryption). These are
   chosen based on current OWASP and NIST guidance. If you ever
   need to bump them in five years, you change them HERE and nowhere
   else

2. Vault file format — the schema version, JSON keys, and default
   file location. Storing the format version means future versions
   of this code can still read today's vaults

3. CLI strings — prompts, error messages, success messages. Kept
   here so they are easy to translate or re-word later

# Argon2id — Key Derivation Function parameters
# =============================================================================
# Argon2id turns a human password into a cryptographic key
# It is deliberately slow and memory-hungry to defeat brute-force
# attacks. These three knobs control HOW slow and HOW memory-hungry
#
# These values are informed by the OWASP Password Storage Cheat
# Sheet, but tuned for a single-user local password manager. OWASP's
# server-oriented configurations use parallelism=1 because a server
# parallelizes ACROSS many simultaneous logins. We use parallelism=4
# because a single user benefits from the speedup on their own
# machine — and an attacker gets the same speedup, so the security
# trade-off is net-neutral. Memory at 64 MiB is comfortably above
# every OWASP profile, which is what makes GPU brute-force expensive

# Number of passes Argon2 makes over its memory buffer
# More passes = slower derivation = harder to brute-force
# 3 is a strong choice for interactive use on modern CPUs
ARGON2_TIME_COST: Final[int] = 3

# Memory used per derivation, in kibibytes (1 KiB = 1024 bytes)
# 65536 KiB = 64 MiB. This defeats GPU/ASIC attackers because
# they have lots of compute but limited fast memory per core
ARGON2_MEMORY_KIB: Final[int] = 65536

# How many parallel threads Argon2 may use
# 4 is a safe default that works on every modern CPU
ARGON2_PARALLELISM: Final[int] = 4

# Salt length in bytes. The salt is random data mixed in with the
# password before hashing — it makes two identical passwords produce
# DIFFERENT keys, so attackers cannot precompute results
# 16 bytes (128 bits) is the standard recommendation
SALT_LENGTH_BYTES: Final[int] = 16

# Argon2 algorithmic invariants — the values below which the math
# does not even make sense. We use these to validate parameters
# loaded from a vault file on disk, so a corrupted or hand-edited
# file cannot make us call Argon2 with nonsense
#   - time_cost >= 1: at least one pass over memory
#   - parallelism >= 1: at least one lane
#   - memory_cost >= 8 * parallelism: Argon2's hard floor (each lane
#     needs at least 8 KiB of memory to function)

# =============================================================================
# AES-256-GCM — Symmetric encryption parameters
# =============================================================================
# AES-256-GCM is the encryption algorithm we use to scramble vault
# contents. "256" means a 256-bit key. "GCM" is a "mode" that adds
# tamper-detection — if anyone changes one byte of the ciphertext,
# decryption will refuse and raise an error

# Key size in bytes. AES-256 wants exactly 32 bytes (256 bits)
# This is also what we ask Argon2 to produce when deriving the key
KEY_LENGTH_BYTES: Final[int] = 32

# Nonce ("number used once") size in bytes
# A nonce is a random value generated FRESH for every encryption
# Reusing a nonce with the same key is catastrophic for GCM —
# it leaks plaintext. So we generate a new 12-byte nonce every save
# 12 bytes is the GCM-recommended size (NIST SP 800-38D)

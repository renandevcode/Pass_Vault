#
# A "justfile" is a list of commands you can run with `just <name>`.
# Think of it as a project's command center — instead of remembering
# `uv run pytest tests/ -v --cov=src`, you just type `just test`.
#
# Why use just instead of make? It is simpler, cross-platform,
# and the syntax is easier to read.
#
# Show all commands:    `just`
# Run a command:        `just <name>`     (e.g. `just setup`)

set export
set shell := ["bash", "-uc"]
set windows-shell := ["powershell.exe", "-NoLogo", "-Command"]
# Make recipe arguments available to shebang scripts as `$1`, `$2`,
# `$@`, and `$#`. Without this, shebang recipes only see args via the
# textual `{{args}}` substitution, which is unsafe for inputs that
# contain `$` (the substituted text gets re-expanded by bash).
set positional-arguments

# Show available commands when you run `just` with no args.
default:
    @just --list --unsorted

# Setup Commands

# One-shot first-time setup — creates .venv and installs everything
[group('setup')]
setup:

    uv venv --allow-existing
    @echo ""
    @echo "Installing dependencies (including dev tools)..."

    @echo "✓ Setup complete!"
    @echo ""
    @echo "Try it out:"
    @echo "  just run -- --help"
    @echo "  just test"

# Install runtime dependencies only (no dev tools)
[group('setup')]

    uv sync

# Install runtime + dev dependencies
[group('setup')]
install-dev:
    uv sync --all-extras


# =============================================================================
# Testing & Quality Checks
# =============================================================================

# Run the test suite
[group('test')]
test:
    @echo "Running tests..."
    uv run pytest

# Run tests with a coverage report
[group('test')]
test-cov:
    @echo "Running tests with coverage..."
    uv run pytest --cov=password_manager --cov-report=term-missing

# Run all linters (ruff + pylint + mypy)
[group('test')]
lint:
    @echo "=== Ruff ==="
    uv run ruff check src tests
    @echo ""
    @echo "=== Pylint ==="
    uv run pylint src/password_manager
    @echo ""
    @echo "=== Mypy ==="
    uv run mypy src/password_manager
    @echo ""
    @echo "✓ All linters passed"

# Auto-format every Python file with yapf
[group('test')]
format:
    @echo "Formatting code with yapf..."
    uv run yapf -i -r src tests
    @echo "✓ Code formatted"

# Auto-fix what ruff can fix on its own (unused imports, etc.)
[group('test')]
fix:
    uv run ruff check src tests --fix


# =============================================================================
# Run the CLI
# =============================================================================

# Run the password-vault CLI — pass extra args after `--`
# Example:  just run -- list
#           just run -- add github
# [no-exit-message] silences just's "Recipe `run` failed with exit
# code N" line when pv exits non-zero. pv uses non-zero exits to
# signal "wrong password", "entry not found", etc — real outcomes
# the CLI already explained, not "the recipe is broken." The exit
# code itself is still propagated to whoever invoked just.
[group('run')]
[no-exit-message]
run *args:
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    # If no args were given, print a friendly usage block and exit
    # cleanly. Without this, `just run` (no args) would invoke
    # `uv run pv` with nothing, argparse would exit 2, and just
    # would tack a "Recipe `run` failed" error on top — confusing for
    # someone just trying to see how the command works.
    if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
        cat <<'EOF'
    Usage: just run -- <command> [args]

    Examples:
      just run -- list
      just run -- add github
      just run -- get github
      just run -- remove github

    See all commands:
      just run -- --help
    EOF
        exit 0
    fi
    # Forward args via "$@" — NOT via {{args}}. Why: {{args}} is a
    # TEXTUAL substitution done by just before bash runs the script,
    # so a password with $ in it would get those $-references expanded
    # as bash variables and arrive at pv mangled. "$@" hands bash the
    # original argv unchanged.
    uv run pv "$@"
